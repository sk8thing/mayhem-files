This is a Github repository devoted to delivering to you
the required files to perform the DeBruijn attack from your HackRF-Portapack

*This is for educational purposes only.
I am in NO WAY liable for any actions executed by means of the contents within this
repository. PLEASE use responsibly.*

*If unfamiliar with the debruijn attack: this attack
transmits a single signal that contains every possible
combination of a specific bit-length in just seconds
by overlapping binary sequences*

*This attack will NOT work on devices that utilize
rollling codes*

## Prerequisites:

### Hardware:
â€¢ HackRF and Portapack

## Getting started:

Transfer these files to a folder called "DeBruijn" at the
root of your Portapack's SD card.

To perform the attack(s), simply use the "Replay" function
within the "Havoc" or "Mayhem" firmware and choose one of
these files in the "DeBruijn" folder

These files are labeled according to what type of key/remote
they are calculated for based on bit-length

Have fun, and *USE RESPONSIBLY*
